# PokeBuilds.
PokeBuilds is an online pokemon team builder, where you can recreate and share your favorite pokemon teams from your favorite games and look at the teams of players. 


## Motivation
The Pokemon team you collect when playing a Pokemon game is a crucial part of the playthrough and the way the experience changes everytime you play. What players are looking to accomplish can drastically what team would be best for them. Pokebuilds seeks to fill this spot by creating a platform for more focused players to save and share great teams in each game for different scenarios, like speed-running, pvp-battling, and other more niche game modes.
