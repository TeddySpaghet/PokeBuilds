# PokeBuilds.
PokeBuilds is an online pokemon team builder, where you can recreate and share your favorite pokemon teams from your favorite games and look at the teams of players. 


## Motivation

What players are looking to accomplish can drastically change what team would be best, when you wanna be the very best.
